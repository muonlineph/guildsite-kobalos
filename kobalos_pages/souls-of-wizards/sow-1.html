"Read the scrolls. And burn them well."<br><br>

His master's instructions four years ago trailed into his mind as Tarrent fingered
through the ashes of the two unnusual scrolls which he kept in a small, leather
waist pouch.  He had learned and burned the scrolls two years ago after his master left
but he still shuddered in using them, avoiding their use whenever possible.<br><br>

He put on his dark tunic, slung his Legendary Staff and quietly left his room, not wishing
to wake any of his gellow apprentices who were fast asleep.  He walked out of the Inn to the
stone-paved Plaza of Lorencia. No one was awake in such an unholy hour and the town looked
serene and peaceful under the bright November full moon.  He strode towards the East Gate
and was hailed by the sentinnel on duty.<br><br>

"Im bound for Noria," Tarrent said, hiding the whereabouts of his true destination to
the sentinnel.<br><br>

"So late in the night?" asked the sentinnel.<br><br>

"Yes, Sir. I need to be there before the sun sets tomorrow." replied Tarrent.<br><br>

"Okay, you may go. You seem like a tough sport for the monsters out there," the sentinnel
said as he pulled on a lever. The East Gate's hinges creaked and slowly grated open.<br><br>

Tarrent strode out of the stone bridge and marched along the path leading to the Dungeons.
The cemetery would just be near the end of the road, before the Dungeons. It was his true
destination, and no one must know about that. That his master chose such a place for their
rendezvous was still a mystery to him.<br><br>

<!-- SECOND COLUMN -->
<td width="45%" valign="top"><br>
His master, along with many other warriors had been called forth by the Lord of Azeroth to the siege in 
Kalima four years ago. But the siege on the evil Kundun was unsuccessful, leading only to the mass murder 
of Mu's finest who entered the cursed realm. His master had just disappeared after that siege though some 
warriors who survived Kundun's wrath recalled memories of his master making a pact with the Kundun. 
Some say that his master has become an ally of the Demon. He only dismissed these rumors believing that 
his master's will and pride were too great to be seared raw by evil, much less succumb himself to the 
Darkness that threatened to reign chaos on their land.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

No one has heard from his master, the Soul Master Azhrael in the four years after his disappearance. 
Not until earlier in the morning when he received a familiar training letter. The letter was obviously 
signed and written by his master himself just like in his younger days when the Soul Master was teaching him 
the basic ways of a wizard. <br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

His master had written:<br><br>
<i>"Lorencian cemetery at midnight, sharp. Utmost secrecy required."</i><br><br>

He had so much to ask from his master and tonight, he would learn if the rumors he heard are true.
