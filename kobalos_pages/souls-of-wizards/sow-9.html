Tarrent continued casting the spell for a time as he strained his eyes towards the spot where his master stood, convincing himself 
that he was just dreaming. But his master was no longer there.  His Soul Barrier had dissolved a few minutes ago, but he hadn't
noticed. Tarrent looked at his army of souls as they were followed where his arms commanded them to go. He stopped casting and his 
Evil Spirits evaporated into nothingness.<br><br>

His eyes drifted on the ground and saw a small glowing object where his master had stood. He walked towards the spot and was 
very much surprised that he could walk with ease. He was suddenly back to the same healthy condition as he was when he entered 
the cemetery.  There was not a trace left of him having ever dueled with his master.<br><br>

As he knelt down to pick up the glowing object, he saw his master's name engraved on an old weather-beaten tombstone that 
must have been lying there for years. He held the glowing object in his hands. It was the Soul of a Wizard, his master's soul.<br><br>

<i>(I dedicate this story to my wizard, the Soul Master tarrent of AZEROTH, server Bahr, to my guildmates, to all wizards and all
Mu-addicts out there. ^_^  I hope you'll love my fanfic.  Enjoy reading! ^_^)</i><br><br><br>

<font color="lightsteelblue"><b>A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE STORY</b></font><br>
<font color="lightsteelblue"><b>About the Title</b></font><br>
True to its title (Souls of Wizards), this story reflects on wizards' spirits.  The Evils Spirits, Tarrent's and lastly, Azhrael's spirit
were featured here.  I've also considered some titles: War of Wizards, A Master's Gift and Souls of Wizards, but I found the last more appropriate.

<font color="lightsteelblue"><b>About the Story</b></font><br>
The story discusses the ways of wizards and wizardry, as I've imagined should be happenning on Mu if the game were true in
real life. (Hehehe.. who knows? ^_^ maybe that's the wizards' lifestyle before the continent of Mu sank down in the Pacific 
Ocean ^_^).<br><br>

I decided to put a master-apprentice relationship between the Dark Wizards and Soul Masters, the same as the knights and
knight-errantry during our real-life Middle Ages.  Tarrent is a Dark Wizard, apprentice to Soul Master Azhrael.  (though, this is
reverse in my Mu characters ^_^).  It only went a bit far-fetched and highly fictitious when I made the notion that "all Dark Wizards
must pass the age-old test, else they will be killed. (though it is still up to the master's discretion, but I want to stress that such events of
survivng is highly unlikely.  Masters tend to kill their apprentices, to prevent the spreading or gossip of the said test ^_^)"<br><br>

I also focused on the wizards' spells, and how a wizard might use them, dealing specially with tarrent's "combo"
when he was still a Dark Wizard.<br><br>

I also thought that the wizards should have a high affinity to the souls of the dead, ahich enables them to control the Evil Spirits and Soul Barrier easily.  
I made it a neccessary requirement for them to become a Soul Master, for the title or rank of 
"Soul Master"  means somewhat like "masters of the soul" for me, if you at it look closely  ^_^<br><br>

Overall, my story deals with Wizard's Souls as
