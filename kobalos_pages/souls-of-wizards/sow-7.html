<!-- MAIN CONTENTS, THE STORY -->

"The higher learning which entails being a Soul Master requires that you have mastered all that a Dark Wizard should learn. 
Being a Soul Master means you have known these spells well enough to call them by heart whenever the need arose. But no, there 
is more to it than that. Being a Soul Master means that you have mastered the ways of the souls, the restless, wandering spirits 
that roam our troubled land," Azhrael added, ignoring his apprentice's question.<br><br>

"If you cannot do these, then you have no right to become a Soul Master at all.  Rise and live up with your fears, wizard. 
Or else die with it," the wizened Soul Master raised his arms in the air.<br><br>

Azhrael maneuvered his arms in such a way that seemed to call 'things' from out of nowhere.  Soon, Evil Spirits in the 
form of transparent black dragons materialized everywhere, most of them rising from the scattered tombs. The cemetery was 
filled with a tumult of wandering souls whose cries and shrieks were combined together in an unearthly low buzz. Azhrael 
moved his arms to and fro, backwards and forward as if herding the chaotic spirits around the field, towards Tarrent.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Tarrent finally managed to stand up, willing himself not to stumble back down as he braced himself for the onslaught. 
What was it that he lacked? He wondered why the other wizards were able to cast the spirit-induced spells fearlessly, 
almost effortlessly. Why couldn’t he do it without fear himself?<br><br>

His legs gave way and he fell down, feeling a cold, eerie shock as one of the translucent spirits swept through him. 
He realized that he did not have any time to contemplate on his weaknesses. He stood up with great effort and held the 
pouch which contained the Evil Spirits' and Soul

Barrier's burnt scrolls in front of him.<br><br>

In the midst of the raging spirits, he opened the pouch and allowed it contents to be carried away by the winds just as he had 
done with the other scrolls a long, long time ago.  He was now ready to let them go. It felt as if he wouldn’t have any more 
chance to do so in the future.<br><br>

"I am a wizard," Tarrent began.<br><br>

"Wizard's blood runs through my veins. Once a wizard, always a wizard," he said as he closed his eyes.<br><br>

"Even unto death," added Azhrael.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Tarrent kept his eyes closed and ignored the chaotic spirits whirling madly about him.  Another spirit passed through, 
but he managed to keep his soul intact. He cast the Soul Barrier around him, his eyes still closed. He tried to ignore 
his fears and concentrated more on what he read from the burnt scrolls. More and more spirits were passing through him 
despite his Soul Barrier's shroud. He felt his soul becoming more and more willing to be taken away in each passing. <br><br>

"Spirits must crash with spirits," he said to himself as he recalled the Evil Spirits' casting stance, and tried to do 
as his master did. He maneuvered and waved his hands from memory, trying to call his own army of Evil Spirits.<br><br>

He felt the presence of many restless souls
