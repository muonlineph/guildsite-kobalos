<!-- MAIN CONTENTS, THE STORY -->
<table cellpadding="6">
<tr><td valign="top" width="55%" valign="top"><br><!-- FIRST COLUMN -->
generation unto generation of Soul Masters who were once apprentice wizards that have successfully passed the rite and found 
the Soul of Wizard. Many apprentices fail this test when they begin to think that they have mastered all that a Dark Wizard 
should learn—and that is the reason why wizards in Mu are few in numbers. The Soul Masters even less.<br><br>

Azhrael thought Tarrent almost had the makings of a Soul Master. It seemed that his apprentice had practiced and studied his 
spells well enough during the years, but he still couldn't give the young wizard his blessing. His eager pupil was still afraid 
and fearful of the spirits or 'ghosts' despite the mastery of spells he was showing tonight. He noticed the frightened and almost 
crazed look on Tarrent's face when he saw the Soul Barrier's faces for the first time. And he also took note that the Evil Spirits 
were never called forth on the wizard's previous arsenal.  Bound by Kundun or not, he must kill Tarrent unless he proves himself 
otherwise.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Azhrael raised his right hand and his body began to glow with an eerie white hue as droplets of arcane energies were absorbed 
into his glowing person. Tarrent stopped casting and nimbly stepped back, panting. Drained and dizzy as he was he tried to focus 
his attention on his master who was now in the middle of a deadly, unstoppable spell.  The light gathering on Azhrael grew in 
intensity and so did the shrill, piercing sound that went with it.<br><br>

Tarrent patiently waited for that one moment where he must Teleport or die in the hands of his master.  Azhrael had become 
a glowing mass, completely enshrouded by the Nova's arcane white energy. He watched as his master arch his hands towards the ground.<br><br>

<!-- SECOND COLUMN -->
<td width="45%" valign="top"><br>
Tarrent had anticipated that motion and Teleported just in time as Azhrael's hand hit the ground.  His master's body expelled 
all the gathered energy in a loud and blinding unearthly explosion just as a dying star would. Nearly a split second passed 
when Tarrent's body was transferred to another plane that mirrors our own, but that was enough to escape the surge of Nova that 
flooded the whole cemetery with deadly white energy.<br><br>

Tarrent returned from the Teleport on the same spot where he previously stood, dropping down on his knees in exhaustion as 
the glowing traces of the previous spell cleared around his master. He could only wonder why his master was still standing 
perfectly unscathed and intact.  His previous rampage didn't even seem to leave any trace on the unmoving sage.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Tarrent shuddered as a cold breeze swept through the deserted cemetery.<br><br>

"Ah, indeed there is reason to fear the righteous rage of wizards," Azhrael looked intently at Tarrent.<br><br>

"I see that you have mastered the offensive spells of a wizard, but you are afraid, aren't you? You are still afraid of Them. 
And I have thought you have grown up of your childhood fears by now," he said.<br><br>

"What is it to you, then?  You are my master no longer," Tarrent shot back as he tried to stand up, only to fall back down.
