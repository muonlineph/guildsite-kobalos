Tarrent sensed the imminent danger of the spell his master was trying to cast and he began to Teleport at rapid intervals around 
the field, trying to feel where the Ice Storm would hit.<br><br>

Azhrael brought his hands down and the cemetery was caught in a deluge of Ice Storm. He vigorously cast the spell on the whole field, 
leaving little room for escape for his apprentice. Ice shards as sharp as daggers met Tarrent before he could Teleport to safety, 
bruising his arms and legs, numbing and freezing him in the process.<br><br>

The spell raged on for a while until shards hit Tarrent on the back and shoulder blades, causing him to tumble down from a Teleport. 
He fell on his knees while ice shards rained on him, making him bleed even more.<br><br>

Suddenly, the Ice Storm stopped. He could smell burning fumes of poisoned gas as he staggered up on his knees to regain his senses. 
Looking up, he saw twin glowing crosses of Decay speeding toward him, leaving a trail of poisonous fumes and bathing the ground 
green with its pale luminescence.<br><br>

*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Nearly drained of life, Tarrent had no more time to Teleport. He knew that an explosion of Decay would send his lost soul 
wandering in the paths of the Lost Towers. Instinctively, he shrouded himself with the Soul Barrier and rotating orbs of 
light enveloped him in a translucent sphere of blue film which absorbed most of the Decay's damage. Azhrael's spell knocked 
Tarrent completely off the ground--but he was still alive, though thoroughly drained and dizzy of the poison.<br><br>

Staggering up, Tarrent saw his master draw back his glowing right hand. In a swift motion, his master brought upon him the Aquabeam 
in full force. Tarrent quickly rose

and performed the same stance, drawing back his own glowing right hand while firmly holding on to his staff, and then returned Azhrael's 
Aquabeam with his own.<br><br>

White hot beams met and rallied with each other in a loud whooshing crash as Azhrael's beam slowly sought dominance over Tarrent's. 
The young wizard thought he was crazy, trying to contest his Aquabeam with that of a Soul Master's. He knew he had no chance 
to penetrate his master's strong spell and that his only chance of survival was to redirect his master's attack.  
Slowly and carefully he tried to angle his right hand which cradled the Aquabeam to a nearby tree when he saw the faces.<br><br>

The Soul Barrier surrounding him had faces!  Each orb circling around him had faces of people etched in blue light. 
Some were laughing. Some were smiling. Some were crying while others had blank looks, yet all were protecting him. 
Tarrent was taken aback at what he saw. He thought the spirits were closing in on him as a vengeance for stirring their fitful sleep. 
He lost his concentration and his Aquabeam faltered.  His vision blurred to white as Azhrael's beam hit him square in the chest, 
sending him sprawling backwards across the ground.<br><br>
<center>*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp
*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Tarrent lay on the ground, surprised he was still alive.  Slowly and painfully he staggered up to face his master, 
his chest steaming. The faces of his Soul Barrier evaporated into nothingness.<br><br>

"You never told me they had faces," Tarrent
