said as he staggered a few steps forward. He thought he would fall, but he didn't.<br><br>

"Of course, they do. They used to be like you and... me," was his master's solemn reply.<br><br>

"Perhaps you can now answer my question," asked Tarrent.<br><br>

"What would you do if I said yes?" Azhrael asked back.<br><br>

"I'll kill you," Tarrent replied coldly.<br><br>

His master didn't reply and a long silence ensued. His wizard's instincts were telling him something was terribly wrong, 
but he couldn't figure it out. Finally, his master spoke.<br><br>

"Yes, I am now allied with the Kundun..."<br><br>

Tarrent couldn't believe what his master was saying, though he could sense the finality in his voice. He couldn't believe 
that his master had become a pawn that will help wreak destruction in their world; that his master, the righteous and 
venerable Soul Master Azhrael had given up all what Mu had been fighting for. One way or another he must kill his master...<br><br>

*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

"How, come?" Tarrent asked, hoping his master was just jesting.<br><br>

"I don't need to tell you that," replied Azhrael.<br><br>

"It is true, then," Tarrent said, accepting the bitterness of the truth he had just heard.<br><br>

"Then you are my master no longer nor am I your

apprentice.  Prepare to die, Soul Master, for I'll kill you now," Tarrent grimly said to his master.<br><br>

"You are my apprentice until I say otherwise," a look of sadness flickered in his old master’s eyes, but it was gone in an instant.<br><br>

"Kill me?  You are welcome to try. Bring it on, wizard," Azhrael challenged as Tarrent eyed him coldly with a look of death dancing 
in his tired blue eyes.<br><br>

*&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp *&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp</center><br>

Tarrent called forth all the remaining strength and energy he had, and rushed headlong towards his master.<br><br>

<i>"There is an element in surprise,"</i> his master used to say, and <i>"A wizard's strength resides on his energy and how he ingeniously 
uses his spells."</i>  He meant to pour these now on his master who had long ago mastered the arts of offensive and defensive energy
 manipulation.<br><br>

Azhrael saw Tarrent charging at him and thought his apprentice would try to bring him down with his fists, 
when Tarrent suddenly vanished. Azhrael turned around, trying to feel where the wizard would reappear. 
He felt an electrocuting shock as bluish-white Lightning knocked him sideways. Spinning around, he saw Tarrent vanish again. 
He felt the same electrocuting shock as he got knocked back and forth by Lightning once more, this time from the front. 
He would have been fried with the spell if he was still a Dark Wizard.  But he was now beyond pain.<br><br>
