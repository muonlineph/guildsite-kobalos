materializing around him. They weren't just ordinary spirits, for they had power which felt strangely familiar. 
What his master said was right. Their ghostly allies used to be like them during their former lives. They were wizards' souls, 
but he had no idea how they ended up in such an estate. Why would they answer to a wizard's call when they were already resting 
in peace and are no longer of this world? They seemed to be confused as to why they were summoned as he felt them circling 
aimlessly around him as if searching for their summoner.  Somehow they felt their summoner was reluctant to issue forth a command, 
so they began to return one by one to the plane from which they came from.<br><br>

Tarrent raised his hands, not wanting the spirits he painfully summoned to leave. He was no longer afraid, as he felt their 
earnest and sincere intention to help him in this dire moment. He began to move his arms, feeling the paths where he must tell 
them to go.<br><br>

He opened his eyes and was dumbstruck by what he saw. His own army of wandering souls met with Azhrael's Evil Spirits one by one, 
crashing headlong with one another. He knew that this couldn't happen, but his legion was devouring his master's army of souls, 
until at last, only his raging army remained whirling and buzzing around around the cemetery. The only target left for them was 
his master.<br><br>

Azhrael had stopped casting. He stood perfectly still in front of his apprentice as Tarrent commanded the Evil Spirits towards him. 
The spirits rushed towards the spot where the Soul Master stood, but they just circled around Azhrael, to Tarrent's amazement.  
They couldn't seem to find their target.<br><br>

Tarrent saw the spirits hunt frantically for their target,

though his master was just in their midst.  He hadn't noticed before, but now he saw how they passed through his master who was 
almost transparent yet still visible to the naked eye.<br><br>

Tarrent watched in horror as Azhrael's unmoving semi-transparent being was slowly mixed with his Evil Spirits starting from 
his knees up to his torso, like a thin vapor of mist rising.  Why hadn't he realized earlier that his master had become 
one of the shades which he used to fear?.<br><br>

"I am glad, that I have taught my apprentice well."  said Azhrael as he slowly evaporated with the dragon-like spirits.<br><br>

"Master, you are... " Tarrent couldn't bring himself to finish the sentence.<br><br>

"We are wizards, you and I, and wizard's blood runs through our veins. Once a wizard, forever a wizard, " Azhrael said.<br><br>

"Look, Tarrent.  My body may be allied with the Kundun but my spirit or my soul is not. Here's a well deserved token for you.  
Use it wisely...," Azhrael said as he slowly blended with Tarrent's whirling black spirits.<br><br>
