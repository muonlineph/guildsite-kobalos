Tarrent continued on with his maneuver a few more times before he entered the Aquabeam
and Twister into play. He Teleported, Aquabeamed, Teleported, and cast Lightning then Twister around his denounced master, 
trying to make him absorb the rhythm of his play.<br><br>

Then he decided to go for it. He let a couple of Twisters loose, quickly Teleported in front of Azhrael and then cast 
a Flame followed by a Cometfall. White-hot comets fell with accuracy on his master as the Flame rose up, burning. 
He shot an Aquabeam then spun around, casting the Inferno with his right hand. All at once, a thick wall of fire 
issued forth with an explosion around him, engulfing his master in infernal flames. Then, he jumped up high with a 
pure cry of rage.  His body got engulfed in flames as hellish fires from the ground etched in the wizard's ancient 
emblem opened up to meet him, shaking the earth violently and bathing his master in more torturous flames upon his landing. 
Tarrent was nearing his limits. He tried to ignore the pain and dizziness he was feeling as he stood up from the Hellfire's 
kneeling landing. He must give it all, if he was to kill his master. He cast another Twister before plunging once again into 
the same cycle of casting.<br><br>

Azhrael had very little time to deliver a counter spell. Every time he tried, the Twister's confusing effects would disorient 
his mind and before he knew it, he would already be engulfed in flames and explosions. Yet, deep inside he felt proud of his 
apprentice who was casting the spells at an exceptional rate for a mid-level wizard just in the prime of manhood. He saw before 
his very eyes that his apprentice had succeeded in combining and mastering the elements of a surprise attack with a proper 
chain of spells unique on his own, a personal series of spells made more potent and alive by his very thought and energy that 
would greatly challenge any assailant on close combat. <br><br>

He tried to look for a gap, an opening that would permit him to break free of his adversary's intense casting, but could find none. 
Truly, any opponent in close range would have

to pay dearly with his life if he were to subdue this raging spell caster. Tarrent would become a strong Soul Master someday, 
he thought. One of the strongest, finest wielders of arcane energies akin to the wizards of old who once roamed Mu.  And by then, 
perhaps the Kundun will finally find its match...<br><br>

He broke out of his thoughts when the notion of 'Soul Master' drifted into his mind. Time was running out, the night's 
shade slowly wearing off. He looked at his unscathed body and it reminded him that it was his duty tonight to make sure that 
his apprentice was ready to be accepted into the sacred inner circle of wizards—that is, the young wizard must prove and exercise 
his skills and knowledge of all spells concerning a Dark Wizard in a duel to the death with the master who has thought him all. 
It was in his wise judgment to kill his apprentice while in the heat of battle, or to spare his life if he proved satisfactory enough.
<br><br>

Apprentices could never expect to win the duel; they might even be killed in the process. This is a cruel initiation rite that 
shrugs off the camaraderie and friendship, or even the fatherly affection that might have been formed between the master and 
apprentice during their years of tutelage.  This is a crucial point in a Dark Wizard's life that comes but once, after which 
his future career as a sorcerer would be determined or be sealed forever in silence.<br><br>

As a Soul Master, only he and others like him knew, for the age-old tradition had been faithfully kept secret, handed down from
